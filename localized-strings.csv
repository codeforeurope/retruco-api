This increases participation from all demographic areas, including disabled individuals, who rarely attend public meetings, but should be heard as a part of any planning project.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Wikiplanning offers an integrated approach utilizing new technologies that increasingly are available to a wide number of a Charrettes’ desired audience. Utilizing the Wikiplanning tools, residents are invited to log into their community’s project, and then are led through a series of activities throughout the project life. These activities include a mix of project-specific Multi-Media Learning Sessions, Online Chat Events, Message Boards, Surveys, and even downloadable Podcasts offering potential walking tours through the project’s principal sites. Taken together, these logically sequenced milestones achieve the desired objectives of Teach; Discuss; Gather Input; and Build Consensus that are fundamental to the Charrette process; and at much higher rates of participation. Although some sessions would occur in real-time, like chats with project managers, most of the activities can be done day or night at the user’s convenience, allowing for far greater participation by people in the workforce. An intangible advantage is the participation of younger members of the community. Generation Y residents rarely attend public meetings, but are increasingly comfortable with online social networking.

It was created on the premise that the Web can be more than an efficient place to find and buy commercial products or to access information on any topic under the sun. It is also an extremely powerful communications medium that provides unprecedented opportunities for people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to connect with, and learn from, each other.</p> <p>Web Lab was founded in the spring of 1997 by Marc Weiss, the creator of the groundbreaking public television series P.O.V. One of Web Lab’s first projects – and probably the one for which it is best known – is the Web Development Fund (<span class=""caps"">WDF</span>), which provides funding and support services for innovative sites proposed by independent producers. The first two rounds of the <span class=""caps"">WDF</span> were conducted in association with <span class=""caps"">PBS</span> <span class=""caps"">ONLINE</span>, which also hosted <span class=""caps"">WDF</span> sites.</p> <p>Web Lab has been hailed for the groundbreaking model it has developed for creating meaningful online dialogues. Using a new technique that The New York Times called “one of the most innovative ideas for creating value and relevance in online conversation,”(full story) Web Lab sets up simultaneous small discussion groups which avoid the verbal fistfights that often plague Internet discussions and instead encourage “dialogues across differences” – in-depth exchanges between people with varying backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Dialogue participants are encouraged to shape the direction of their conversations and develop a sense of ownership that is both powerful and unique among the Web’s standard asynchronous dialogue practices.</p> <p>Web Lab has received support from <span class=""caps"">PBS</span>, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Ford Foundation and other private foundations. Web Lab is the operations program of Digital Innovations Group, a 501©(3) non-profit incorporated in the state of Delaware.</p",,

It took over a week for news to travel from Monticello to Philadelphia by horse; now it flashes around the world in seconds via Twitter. Yet our government still runs on essentially the same horse-drawn design. If we look with fresh eyes and discard analog assumptions, what kind of democracy can we build for the digital era?</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Hyperarchy is our attempt to answer that question. Hyper•archy means non-sequentially linked government. In a hierarchy, power flows upward through a rigid, slowly-changing structure. It’s the Washington elite, debating the fate of millions on the Senate floor. In a hyperarchy, by contrast, power flows through a complex network of personal relationships, continually pooling and dispersing in an ever-shifting landscape of trust and influence. Like an operating system for democracy, Hyperarchy strips away the formality and procedures we normally associate with government, relying instead on software to give structure and meaning to organic human conversation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hyperarchy provides “just enough structure to the conversation so that conclusions can be drawn, but doesn’t weigh you down with a lot of steps and mechanisms.”</p",,

Since its inception, CitizenSpeak has serviced organizations from all across the country, including formal organizations with long term goals, as well as individuals using CitizenSpeak for one-time issue-oriented actions.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>In 2005, CitizenSpeak was re-launched on the CivicSpace platform to provide users with a more dynamic service. CivicSpace (formerly DeanSpace) is a growing set of online tools for building political websites based on the Drupal open source content management system. The code that runs CitizenSpeak is available as an open source CivicSpace module at http://www.civicspacelabs.com. We hope that other organizations and developers will use this free and open source software to offer e-advocacy services to their members and communities.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The CivicSpace/CitizenSpeak open source module was built by George Hotelling who also implemented the current CitizenSpeak site. The site was designed by Development Seed.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>CitizenSpeak was co-founded by Jo Lee and Pablo Calamera. Pablo built the first site and provided much of the vision though was only able to participate in the project for a short period of time. Jo continues to run the service with the constant help from the larger progressive non-profit IT community and its commitmant to transparency and building a better world.</p> </blockquote> <p>All in all, CitizenSpeak is a tool that probably falls more into the e-advocacy than the participation category, though it could be used for surfacing feedback as well.</p",,

In contrast to the completely asynchronous, broadcast-to-broadcast mode of existing threaded messaging systems, the Rotisserie adds structure to both the timing and the flow of the discussion. The timing of the discussion is broken into semi-synchronous rounds. Users are allowed to post responses at any time, but their responses are not published to other users until the deadline for the current round passes. This structure allows users to put significant thought into their responses rather than competing with other participants to post first. More important, this structure allows the system to control the flow of the discussion by distributing responses to specific users for further discussion at the end of each round, ensuring that every post is distributed to at least one other user for comment and that each user has exactly one post to which to respond. Lastly, the Rotisserie system includes support for discussion not only within a given class, but also between many different classes at once, allowing, for instance, Internet law classes at <span class=""caps"">HLS</span> and Cambridge to participate in a discussion about digital rights management with an engineering course at <span class=""caps"">MIT</span>.</p> </blockquote",,

"178647",,"<p><span class=""caps"">DEMOS</span> (Delphi Mediation Online System) is a new online platform and specific method of supporting large scale citizen participation and result oriented public debates on the Internet – on a local, national or international level.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">DEMOS</span> stands for Delphi Mediation Online System and integrates three well-proven social research methods, namely the Survey technique, the Delphi approach and the Mediation method. Starting with the classic Survey technique, this method is designed for representative opinion polls and contributes to public opinion formation on a large-scale basis by including (virtually) the entire population. This technique allows to monitor the opinion shaping process and to come to collectively accepted decisions. While the level of interactivity of standardised surveys is rather limited, Delphi polls operate with a higher amount of interactive feedback and can especially be used to systematically exploit expert knowledge. The basic idea is to generate a consensus among a number of domain experts by aggregated feedback. Feedback is supplied by the ‘Delphist’ on a strictly anonymous and statistical basis to exclude direct personal influence among the participants. A Delphi process runs through two (or more) cycles of interview-feedback-interview. After each cycle the experts are asked to rethink their original answers in the light of the statistically aggregated ‘group opinion’ that has emerged in the previous cycle, until a satisfactory level of convergence or (statistical) consensus is reached.</p> <p>Whereas both Survey and Delphi are quantitative methods, the Mediation technique is a qualitative method used to reveal problems and resolve conflicts. The basic idea of Mediation is that consensus is not a statistical figure but a negotiated compromise. Mediation is a group process chaired by an impartial mediator, and often running through several cycles of open discussion.</p",,

The essence of Nomic is captured in the motto that ‘to play the game is to change the rules.’ The initial rule set outlines mechanics for play, but these rules are changed by play itself.

It provides citizens with the opportunity to get involved, and decision-makers with the opportunity to harness the perspective and passion of citizens.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[…]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>What’s so different about the process?</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>CitiZing! helps decision-makers create meaningful and transparent public processes with clearly-defined and influential citizen roles. It also provides a space for citizens to collaborate together and bring forth their concerns and ideas in a productive and effective way. It does this by facilitating the Citizens League unique model of problem-solving, taking place in three phases: problem diagnosis, analysis and conclusion, and implementation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>CitiZing! combines the power of social networking with easy-to-use tools, like surveys, wikis, forums, prioritizers, and stakeholder maps, to provide the toolkit to work through problems collectively. Work can be done either exclusively online or in complement to existing in-person activities. Right now CitiZing! hosts one of the Citizens League’s most important projects, which aims to refresh how we think about and solve poverty. We’ll be adding more projects soon, and in the future both individuals and organizations will be able to start and run their own projects.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can follow CitiZing on Twitter at <a href=""http://twitter.com/CitiZing"">@CitiZing</a>.</p",,

It is also a place to ask questions, where the most popular or relevant questions bubble to the top, so all can quickly see timely topics at any given moment.

Furthermore, the characteristics and demands of the role may make it hard for moderators to be fully successful in their task, especially when tackling multiple synchronous discussions.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The Argunaut consortium was formed with the purpose of providing moderators with a computerized tool and its associated pedagogical methodology to support and increase their effectiveness and thereby the quality of the monitored e-discussions.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Argunaut’s Moderator Interface will provide the moderator with an overall solution for awareness and feedback/intervention options. It will support the moderators’ awareness of important occurrences in ongoing e-discussions via the “shallow loop”, which provides constantly updating visualizations (“awareness displays”) summarizing important characteristics of the ongoing discussion. The design of the indicators and visualizations will incorporate feedback from experts as well as the projected end users (teachers, initially), and will cover a variety of dimensions (e.g., participation, social engagement, critical reasoning), also building on the fruits of the “deep loop” AI module. Argunaut will attempt to characterize points or aspects in the process of discussion where potential moderator/facilitator intervention might be required (even before such situations become problematic), alert the moderator of these issues, and provide the moderator with intervention/feedback tools to address these issues and in some cases with pertinent advice. Several other functionalities are also planned, including options for text search of key words, specification of and search for patterns (e.g. structural patterns) and annotation of discussion contents. These options may facilitate both the online monitoring of e-discussions and the offline post-discussion reflection and analysis of these discussions.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Currently, the Moderator’s Interface is being implemented for two graphical e-discussion tools, Digalo and FreeStyler/CoolModes. Argunaut’s system architecture will be characterized by “openness” and adaptability (to a variety of different platforms, contexts and users). It will be configurable and offer a wealth of options to the moderator. We also plan on utilizing feedback from teachers and other moderators in our extensive experimentation and evaluation phase, in order to provide them with the best possible support.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>We, the Argunaut team, welcome you to this website and encourage you to browse and have a look around. We recommend that you first have a look at our brochure and at our project’s highlights page.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Argunaut is a Research &amp; Development project sponsored by the 6th Framework Program of the European Community, planned for 33 months from December 2005 onwards. Foreseen exploitable results include software tools, research practices, training courses, and more.</p> </blockquote> <p>From the homepage:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Argunaut project was formed with the following goals:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>* to develop appropriate tools to assist moderators of e-discussions (automatic detection of attacks, of racism, of subservise argumentation, recurrent discussion patterns, individual argumentation difficulties …)<br> * to unify awareness, feedback and intervention mechanisms in e-discussion environments<br> * to combine AI analysis module with online realtime monitoring module<br> * to implement cross-platform: currently with Digalo and FreeStyler for education field. Later perhaps with M2T and Map-It, forum/blog platforms and, why not, Twitter.<br> * to study the moderator’s role, especially in synchronous, graphical e-discussions</p> </blockquote> <p>As of May 8, 2014, the site is not available.

There’s a projected deficit of at least 1.7 billion dollars for fiscal year 2011, which begins July 1, 2010.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Travel to different locations on the main map. Each location represents a policy area (like higher education, revenues, or general government) where you can choose different budget options. Click on an option to select it. Click on it again if you change your mind.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>In each location, there are advisors you can consult for more information and factors to consider.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>You need to pay attention to this year’s budget balance. Making the “current year balance” a positive number is what you are required to do under the constitution.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>You should also pay attention to the long-term balance. This adjusts for all sorts of one-time actions (like transferring funds from reserves or temporary employee furloughs) that affect this year’s budget, but not the underlying sources of ongoing income and ongoing expenditure needs. If you can get the long-term balance to be a positive number, you’ll put the state’s finances on a sustainable path for the future.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Each choice you make will not only affect the budget totals, it will also affect your popularity with ten different interest groups. If you make too many of these groups too unhappy, it might affect your and your party’s political future badly. The interest groups will appear from time to time all by themselves. If you want to visit them, you can go to the click the icon on the main map.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>When you are done, check out the summary to see how your budget ended up.</p> </blockquote> <p>While it appears this is not a stand-alone tool it is being <a href=""http://envisionprincegeorges.org/blog/congratulations-youre-governor-now-balance-the-budget/"">referenced</a> in the <em>Envision Prince George’s</em> project.

On WinXX the smb protocol is used. On Linux or Unix clients, rsync or tar (over ssh/rsh/nfs) can be used * Flexible restore options.

The game provides a basic introduction to the redistricting system, allows players to explore the ways in which abuses can undermine the system, and provides info about reform initiatives – including a playable version of the Tanner Reform bill to demonstrate the ways that the system might be made more consistent with tenets of good governance. Beyond playing the game, the web site for The Redistricting Game provides a wealth of information about redistricting in every state as well as providing hands-on opportunities for civic engagement and political action.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Redistricting Game was created at the <span class=""caps"">USC</span> Game Innovation Lab – part of the <span class=""caps"">USC</span> School of Cinematic Arts’, Interactive Media Division.

"189242",,"<p>Amplify was created by Clipmarks, <span class=""caps"">LLC</span>, a New York City based company. The Company’s philosophy on information sharing is comprised of three main principles:</p> <ul> <li>People can do a better job than algorithms of filtering the massive amount of information that’s available on the web;</li> <li>Serendipitous discovery is often more compelling than information organized by topic; and</li> <li>Limiting the length of shared content allows people to learn about more topics than they would otherwise have time or patience for.</li> </ul> <p>Their site explains how it works as follows: “Much of the activity on the social web involves people sharing links to articles and blog posts they want to share with others. But what about when there’s a specific part of an article you want to discuss? Sharing a link to the entire article won’t do the job. With Amplify, you can clip any specific part of what you’re reading, add as much commentary as you like and then share a link directly to the clip. Amplify syncs with Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Friendfeed, and Delicious so you can keep your friends and followers around the web updated with what you’re reading.”</p",,

The procedure is as follows: At 12 noon, on the last weekday of each month, the five top rated ideas on Better Reykjavík and the top rated idea of each category are moved into a specific area on the Better Reykjavík site after which they can no longer be rated. These ideas, along with the arguments and discussions about them, are addressed in the appropriate standing committee as soon as possible. They should preferably be addressed within one month.

In too many of the world’s democracies, public corruption goes unchecked, extremist parties direct the political agenda, and voters doubt whether the democratic process can deliver for them. Citizens deserve more from democracy, and democracy is in need of fresh ideas.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Frustrated by the endemic corruption and electoral dysfunction of his native Czech Republic, mathematician and anti-corruption activist Karel Janeček began work on a new model voting system in 2012. The system, tested for the first time in October 2013, challenges centuries-old presumptions of how voters can participate in the democratic process. […]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[…]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Democracy 2.1 (D21) offers a new degree of power and flexibility to voters. Voters who prefer to vote in the traditional fashion – a single vote for a single candidate – may do so. D21’s innovation is to offer voters the additional option of casting up to four equally weighted “plus votes” and two “minus votes,” allotted to whatever candidates the voter chooses, at one vote per candidate. Voters are thus empowered to register their opinion on a broader range of candidates and ideas, and those who engage more closely in the electoral process – regardless of age, gender, or wealth – will have a relatively stronger impact on the outcome.</p> </blockquote> <p>The website contains more information about the first <a href=""http://www.democracy21.info/testing-d21/"">field test</a> of Democracy 2.1, held in 2013.</p",,
